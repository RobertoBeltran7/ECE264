# **ECE 264: Advanced C Programming**

**Course Description:**
Continuation of a first programming course. Topics include files, structures, pointers, recursion, and the proper use of dynamic data structures. 

### **List of HW Assignments**

- **HW4: Clustering Data**<br/>
This assignment introduces the k-mean algorithm and requires an implementation written in C. It also introduces the debugging process and generation of test cases.

- **HW5: Quick Sort**<br/>
This assignment introduces reading integers from a file to an array and using the qsort() function on the array.

- **HW6: Structures and Binary Files**<br/>
This assignment introduces reading/writing binary files using the fread() and fwrite() functions. It also introduces the use of structures and building a Makefile for testing.

- **HW10: Image Enhancement (Color to Grayscale)**<br/>
This assignment introduces reading/writing image files and manipulating the image data.

- **HW13: Partition of Linked Lists**<br/>
This assignment introduces implementation and partitioning of a linked list.

- **HW14: Merge Sort Using Linked List**<br/>
This assignment continues with implementation of linked lists and performing merge sort on linked lists.

- **HW15: Removal of Duplicate Elements in Linked Lists**<br/>
This assignment continues with linked list traversal, linking and node deletion to eliminate duplicate nodes from a linked list.

- **HW16: Mutally Contained Binary Trees**<br/>
This assignment introduces traversal and searching of nodes in binary trees using recursion.

- **HW17: Node's Distance in a Binary Search Tree**<br/>
This assignment introduces binary search trees and various traversals of a binary search tree. It also continues with the use of recursion to search for nodes and compute the distance of a node to the root node of the BST.

- **HW20: Huffman Part 1**<br/>
This assignment introduces Huffman decoding and using tree traversal to decode. It also introduces reading bits from a file and using a file header to create a Huffman tree.

- **HW21: Huffman Part 2**<br/>
This assignment continues with Huffman decoding and using tree traversal to decode. It also introduces the use of a Huffman tree, obtained from the file header, to decode an entire file.
